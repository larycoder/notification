## Project motivation

Inspired from the mail system design.
I write a simple note system run on web browser interface.
The purpose is for gaining skill (minor) and release my stress (major).

The note design should be straightforward.
For interface, it is a list of notes.
Each note contains a subject and content.
Besides, each note could be tagged by multiple tag label.

***RIP*** I leverage my old project and rebuild it
because it is more convenient than write new one.
The name is keep as same as old one but purpose is totally changed.
