# Notification
This project is aimed at developing a time-indexing notebooks for time-management purpose


## Starting point on time management

- The planning notes is not necessary since it will become trash without useful value.
- If there are afraid of missing valuable content, then it should not be in here.
- The time management is not a store for everything, it is a cache for your current work.
- If time management works as milestone, then it can hold info of a month, a week and a day.
- Actually, it can be archived after amount of time with unit of day.
- Time management start with topic + description + notes.
- I need somewhere to note down sth and look back it in time. Searching engine will be core of system.
- So the main idea is notes and look back.
- Leverage technology is pretty good option. -> notification project could be stand stone.

## Technique view
The project follows email style since it is my first imagination on how this system would effectively work.
