# Introduction
This file mention about the reason why I want to build my own notebook

# SOTA
I will list out some common tools that is used to take notes

1. Microsoft word/Docs:
    Pros: Good for write document with beautiful representing
    Cons: Complex, slow and not support well query language

2. Excel :
    Pros: Good for make a spreadsheet and support many lookup and comuting function
    Cons: Slow, unfamiliar query language (with me) and not proper for taking notes (semi-structure)

3. Notepad :
    Pros: Simple, fast and can note whatever you want
    Cons: Not query support, not spreadsheet support, not beautiful representing

# Requirement:
From my view, I want the program that is fast bootup, simple and auto save content. Moreover, I want it that could be modify as normal text (ofcourse most of time I will note in semi-structural way). And sometimes, I want to look on it as a spreadsheet (table like) and query or sort data.

Additional, I expect to build my own query and store it as list of my own toolset which I can use for fast query. And sometime, I want to query on whole content so grep support is a good option.

# Revision (2021-09-09)

[INFO] I have some forward step from the starting point of this project. I have a better idea with clearer view on the system.

[INFO] I detect that initial project ambition is quite impossible then that why its implementation met difficulty and could not continue.

[INFO] I update new README and restart project. (requirement hold on README for now)
