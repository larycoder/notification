Hello guy !

Firstly, I want to welcome you to visit and use my app.

This is a time management app that designed to control daily activity through
list of cards. You will have
2 options: Diary and Task. Diary cards is designed allowing you to write down
your daily activity including start time and duration. On the other hand, Task
cards is more simpler and you can use it to write down your long-term activity
and event note down your plan in there. It supports deadline and task measurement
also. Then depending on your effort of updating the card, the app calculate and
provide you a report about your activities (coming soon). The app has a back-end
system that help you to store your card so that your app does not need to
perform any heavy task on its side but requiring you to lunch back-end yourself
for now.

This app is designed by a back-end developer so do not expected too much on its
art.
